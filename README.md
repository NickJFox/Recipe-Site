# Recipe-Site

## Search recipes, look at the instructions & ingredients, and save the recipes you like.

The JavaScript code utilizes asynchronous fetching to retrieve recipe data from the Spoonacular API. It includes functions for fetching recipes based on pagination and search queries, rendering recipe lists by dynamically creating HTML elements, and handling user interactions such as saving or removing recipes. 

The code interacts with the browser's local storage to store and retrieve saved recipes. It also performs DOM manipulation to update the page dynamically, attaches event listeners to handle user actions, and utilizes various algorithms such as asynchronous fetching, rendering, local storage manipulation, DOM manipulation, and event handling to create a functional recipe search and management system.  

* Create a recipe website.
* Fetch data from recipe API and display them.
* Create search bar to look for keywords in recipes.
* Create a save button to allow users to save recipes.
* Apply a remove button to also remove recipes that have been saved.
